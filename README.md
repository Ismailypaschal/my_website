What I changed

- Added `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html` and wired navigation links.
- Centralized and improved responsive styles in `style.css` (CSS variables, mobile nav, projects grid, contact form).
- Made `script.js` defensive and added active-link highlighting.

How to run locally

1. From this folder run a simple static server. Using Python 3:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes / Next steps

- Replace placeholder content in the new pages with your real copy.
- Consider extracting the header/footer into a server-side include or templating system if your host supports it.
- If you want I can further polish spacing, typography, and add animations.
